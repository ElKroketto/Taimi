# TAIMI
Easy-to-use time and task tracking for all kinds of projects!
TAIMI (Samoan for *Time*) is a simple web app to manage various projects for one or more 
different customers or clients. 

###Current features
+ Enter tasks and assign a status of accomplishment (*open*, *in progress*, *paused* and *done*)  
+ Prioritize every job so you always know what the next step is
+ Add all your clients and link a task to the corresponding customer. This way you
never forget what you're spending your time (and money!) for
+ Keep track of the working time and what you've been doing
+ Quickly get an overview of the working time of the last important periods (today, yesterday, 
current week and month, last month etc.)
