                    TAIMI (Samoan language for <em>Time</em> according to <a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=de#sm/en/taimi" target="_blank">Google Translator</a>)
                    is a simple to use and stable time and task tracker for all kind of projects. Furthermore it was the
                    perfect sample project for me to dive deeper into different PHP based ORM-frameworks.
